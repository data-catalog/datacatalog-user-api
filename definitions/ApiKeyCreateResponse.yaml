title: ApiKeyCreateResponse
description: |-
  ApiKey model sent by the server to the client after the generation of a new api key.
  Note that the actual key is only sent once after the creation of the key, and will only be stored a hashed version of it on the server. Make sure to save the key, as it is not recoverable.
